# Introduction to Programming

## Practical 9: Abstract Classes 

## Instructions

This week the practical focuses on inheritance, class hierarchy and in particular abstract classes
in the context of a more complex program the fox-rabbit simulator. You will need to download the Foxes and Rabbits code as a starting point 

### Level 1:

1. __Implementation.__ The Foxes-and-Rabbits simulation: using the code provided 
create a class _Wolf_ that hunts foxes and rabbits.
Initially create the _Wolf_ class by simply copying the class Fox, changing the name everywhere
needed and keeping all its default values, add the ability to eat foxes, making foxes worth 14, i.e.
twice the food value of rabbits. Note: you will have to make the following changes in the class
_Simulator_.
   * insert:
`private static final double WOLF_CREATION_PROBABILITY = 0.02;`
after
`private static final double RABBIT_CREATION_PROBABILITY = 0.08;`
   * In the constructor insert:
`view.setColor(Wolf.class, Color.black);`
after
`view.setColor(Fox.class, Color.red);`
   * In the `populate` method add the following code

  ```java
else if(rand.nextDouble() <= WOLF_CREATION_PROBABILITY) {
  Location location = new Location(row, col);
  Wolf wolf = new Wolf(true, field, location);
  animals.add(wolf);
}
```

   Run the simulation and observe what happens to the foxes and  the rabbits. (note you may find
 the `SimulatorView.isViable()` method is being called and halts  your simulation).

2. Change the Wolves behaviour in the following way:


  ```
// The age to which a wolf can live.
private static final int MAX_AGE = 40;
// The likelihood of a wolf breeding.
private static final double BREEDING_PROBABILITY = 0.05;
// The maximum number of births.
private static final int MAX_LITTER_SIZE = 2;
```
  Run the simulation and observe what happens to the foxes and the rabbits.

3. Additionally change the Wolves behaviour in the following way:

   ```
   private static final int FOX_FOOD_VALUE = 7;
   ```
   
   Run the simulation and observe what happens to the foxes and the rabbits.

### Level 2

__Implementation.__ The Foxes-and-Rabbits simulation: Implement a class _Hunter_, modifying your design
from level 1 accordingly. A hunter does not breed and becomes inactive after a random period of
time. A hunter is a predator for rabbits, foxes and wolves.
To do this use the concept of an abstract class introduced in the lecture to implement an _Actor_
abstract class as shown in the lecture that is a suitable super class for all the actors (animal and
human) in the simulation.

### Level 3

__Investigation.__ You can read more about emergent behaviour and swarming/flocking in agent based
systems here:
